pwd# Chat Feed Proof-of-Concept App

A minimal full-stack app demonstrating a real-time chat feed using Node.js/Express (backend) and Socket.io (real-time communication) with a simple HTML/JS frontend.

## Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io (for real-time messaging)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Socket.io client
- Storage: In-memory array (for POC simplicity)
- Development: VS Code with RooCode code agent

## Setup
1. Clone the repo or create folders as per steps.
2. Run `npm install` in the root.
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`.

## Steps Documentation
[This section will be updated per step]

## API Usage
- WebSocket endpoint: `/socket.io/` (real-time messages)
- No external APIs used in this POC (internal only).

## Cost Tracking
[To be filled per step]

## Testing
Open `client/index.html` in a browser or use the served endpoint.

## Enhancements & Publishing
[To be added at end]

### Step 1 Verification  
- Fixed: Updated package.json with "dev" script using nodemon. 
- Installed: express, socket.io, nodemon. 
- Test: npm run dev starts server; localhost:3000 serves index.html. 
- No RooCode API costs incurred. 
- Openweb UI API costs incurred (to 7:34): $0.005205
- Tokens in: 18,439
- Tokens out: 5,355

### Step 2 Verification  
- Fixed: Static file path using path.join(__dirname, '../client') for proper serving of index.html.
- Tested: localhost:3000 loads HTML page; multiple tabs connect (server logs show socket IDs).
- No RooCode API costs incurred. 
- Openweb UI API costs incurred: $0.00899
- Columative Openweb UI API costs incurred (to 7:50):
- Tokens in: 30,613
- Tokens out: 6,001

### Step 3: Frontend Integration
- Created script.js: Socket.io client for connect, load/send/receive messages, DOM updates (auto-scroll).
- Added styles.css: Basic UI (responsive chat box, styled messages/input).
- User input: Simple username prompt.
- Tested: Multi-tab chatâ€”messages send from one tab, appear live in others; reloads preserve history.
- API Notes: WebSocket events (load-messages, new-message); in-memory sync across clients.
- No RooCode API costs incurred. 
- Openweb UI API costs incurred: $0.01402
- Columative Openweb UI API costs incurred (to 8:03):
- Tokens in: 54,954
- Tokens out: 8,435
